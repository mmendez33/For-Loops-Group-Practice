# Problem 1:
# Ask the user to enter a list of student scores (one by one).
# Use a while loop to continuously accept scores until the user enters a negative number.
# For each score, use nested if statements to categorize the score:
# 90-100: Print "Excellent"
# 70-89: Print "Good"
# 50-69: Print "Pass"
# Below 50: Print "Fail"
# Stop the loop and print the final count of each category when the user enters a negative number.

score = int(input("Enter a list of student scores:"))

# while score >0:             #  will accept scores unless user enters a number below zero
#     continue
#     score = int(input("Enter a list of student scores:"))

# Problem 2: Even and Odd Counter with Conditions
# Ask the user for a starting and ending number.
# Use a for loop to iterate from the starting to the ending number.
# Inside the loop:
# Use nested if to check if the number is both even and greater than 10. If true, count it as a “special even” number.
# If it’s odd and less than 20, count it as a “special odd” number.
# Print the counts for both “special even” and “special odd” numbers.
